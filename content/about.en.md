# About
We are a few people that like to train Parkour together and outside in Hamburg. All trainings are free of charge and everyone's acting on their own responsibility. There are no official trainers, we're not a registered association and there are also no permanent "leaders". All people interested should be able to use this platform to organize trainings with others.

All trainings are open to everyone. You're welcome here, no matter what your parkour skills, your overall "fitness" or your motives to train parkour are.

All training you're seeing here will take place. Sometimes we move on to another spot during a training so you should be at the given spot on time when nobody else knows that you'll come to the training. When it starts raining rather unexpectedly right before the training, we sometimes change the spot and also update the training entry here: It makes sense to look into it again right before the training.

For planning and communication purposes we also have a chat group in the messenger [Signal](https://signal.org/). Nevertheless all training will be posted on this website. To join the chat group, just ask when we meet at a training. For any questions or feedback contact us via e-mail at {{< nobreak >}}**punkt-aâ’¶mailbox.org**{{< /nobreak >}}.

Ableism, antisemitism, hatred against queer people, racism, sexism and other discriminatory ideologies and behaviors are not welcome. That doesn't mean we're all free from these kinds of internalized patterns of thought or behavior. But we expect from all participants to develop self-awareness in that regard and not further reproduce all this. If you have any fundamental problems with that, don't come to any trainings.

Motivation for creating this website was the situation of the parkour scene in Hamburg 2022: There were no free parkour trainings that were announced openly on the internet. That's what we as Point A want to change with this website.
