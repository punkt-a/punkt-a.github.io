## Participate
{{< qa "How do I participate?" >}}
Just join us at one of the trainings.
{{< /qa >}}
{{< qa "I've never done any Parkour before, can I still join in?" >}}
Yes. You should't expect an extensive beginner's course because we're all there for training not for exclusively teaching. But of course others with more experience are going to show you all the basics.
{{< /qa >}}

Click on "Trainings" at the top of the site, you'll see all upcoming (and past) training sessions there.
{{< /qa >}}
{{< qa "Where do the trainings take place?" >}}
It's in every training entry under "Spot". You can click the spot there to get to the spot entry. The links there will lead you to the exact location.

No.
{{< /qa >}}

No. It's possible that someone with a Parkour trainer license also participates in a training session but never in there role as a licensed trainer.

No. We're not a registered association.
{{< /qa >}}

Usually 2-3 times per week which depends on different conditions like weather, vacations etc. If you want to train with others more often, look into the "Contribute" section.
{{< /qa >}}

Currently no. It's possible this will be a thing in the future. If you're interested in organizing this as part of Punkt A, get in touch.
{{< /qa >}}
{{< qa "Are there indoor Parkour gym sessions?" >}}
No, not under the Punkt A "label"/on this website. Punkt A is explicitely about outdoor training sessions, especially because it's often not free of charge to use Parkour gyms.

## Parkour itself
{{< qa "What is Parkour?" >}}
Parkour was initially about the most efficient way of movement from one place to anotherwith nothing but one's own body and while overcoming any obstacles in the way. Today the term isn't used that strictly but also includes free running which introduces more "inefficient" movement such as flips or other "flow" moves. You can read more about all that in the {{< link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour" >}}Wikipedia article about Parkour{{< /link >}}.
{{< /qa >}}
{{< qa "What do I need to do Parkour?" >}}
Two things are relevant: Clothing and shoes. Your clothing should't limit your mobility, ideal are most kinds of "sports clothing" or "loose clothing" that you don't trip over. E.g. skinny jeans might limit your movement too much. Your shoes shouldn't be too stiff so you still feel the surfaces with your feet. Most kinds of trainers are fine but there are also a lot of normal sneakers that are very good for doing Parkour. "The best shoes for Parkour" are a science unto itself and it's a very individual thing. It's not that important when starting out.

No. This was actually a coincidence: Both projects emerged at roughly the same time under the same name in different languages. But it's quite a cool project, check it out: {{< link "https://www.pointaparkour.com/" >}}Point A Parkour{{< /link >}}
