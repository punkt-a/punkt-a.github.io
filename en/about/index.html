<a class=nav-link href=/en/faq/>FAQ</a></nav></div></div><div id=content><h1 id=about>About</h1><p>We are a few people that do Parkour together and outdoors in Hamburg. All trainings are free of charge and everyone&rsquo;s acting on their own responsibility. There are no official trainers, we&rsquo;re not a registered association and there are no permanent &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;. All people interested shall be able to use this platform to organize training sessions with others.</p><p>All trainings are open to everyone. You&rsquo;re welcome here, no matter what your parkour skills, your overall &ldquo;fitness&rdquo; or your motives for doing parkour are.</p><p>Training sessions you see on the website will definitely take place. Sometimes we move on to another spot during a session so you should be at the given spot on time when nobody else knows you&rsquo;ll come. When it starts raining rather unexpectedly right before a training, we sometimes change the spot and also update the entry here on the website: It makes sense to look into it again right before the start.</p><p>For planning and communication purposes we also have a chat group on <a href=https://signal.org/>Signal</a> messenger. Nevertheless all trainings will be posted on this website. To join the chat group, just ask when we meet during a session. For any questions or feedback contact us via e-mail at <span style=white-space:nowrap>punkt-aⒶsystemli.org</span>.</p><p>Ableism, antisemitism, hatred against queer people, racism, sexism and other discriminatory ideologies and behaviors are not welcome. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re all free from these kinds of internalized patterns of thought or behavior. But we expect from all participants to develop self-awareness in that regard and not further reproduce all this. If you have any fundamental problems with that, stay away. Members and sympathizers of the police, military or other repressive agencies are not welcome.</p><p>Motivation for creating this website was the situation of the parkour scene in Hamburg 2022: There were no free parkour trainings that were announced openly on the internet. That&rsquo;s what we as Punkt A want to change with this website.</p></div><div id=footer><a href=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html><img src=/images/a-circle.svg alt="A in a circle">
