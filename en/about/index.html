<a class=nav-link href=/en/faq/>FAQ</a></nav></div></div><div id=content><h1 id=about>About</h1><p>We are a few people that do Parkour together and outdoors in Hamburg. All trainings are free of charge and everyone&rsquo;s acting on their own responsibility. There are no official trainers, we&rsquo;re not a registered association and there are no permanent &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;. All people interested shall be able to use this platform to organize training sessions with others.</p><p>All trainings are open to everyone. You&rsquo;re welcome here, no matter what your parkour skills, your overall &ldquo;fitness&rdquo; or your motives for doing parkour are.</p><p>Training sessions you see on the website will definitely take place. Sometimes we move on to another spot during a session so you should be at the given spot on time when nobody else knows you&rsquo;ll come. When it starts raining rather unexpectedly right before a training, we sometimes change the spot and also update the entry here on the website: It makes sense to look into it again right before the start.</p><p>For planning and communication purposes we also have a chat group on <a href=https://signal.org/>Signal</a> messenger. Nevertheless all trainings will be posted on this website. To join the chat group, just ask when we meet during a session. For any questions or feedback contact us via e-mail at <span style=white-space:nowrap>punkt-aⒶsystemli.org</span>.</p><p>Ableism, antisemitism, hatred against queer people, racism, sexism and other discriminatory ideologies and behaviors are not welcome. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re all free from these kinds of internalized patterns of thought or behavior. But we expect from all participants to develop self-awareness in that regard and not further reproduce all this. If you have any fundamental problems with that, stay away.</p><p>Motivation for creating this website was the situation of the parkour scene in Hamburg 2022: There were no free parkour trainings that were announced openly on the internet. That&rsquo;s what we as Punkt A want to change with this website.</p></div><div id=footer><a href=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html><img src=/images/a-circle.svg alt="A in a circle">
