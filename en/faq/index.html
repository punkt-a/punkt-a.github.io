Punkt A is explicitely about outdoor training sessions, especially because it's often not free of charge to use Parkour gyms.</div></details></p><p> </p><h2 id=parkour-itself>Parkour itself</h2><p><div id=what-is-parkour class=anchor></div><details><summary><span class=faq-question>What is Parkour?<span></summary><div class=faq-answer>Parkour was initially about the most efficient way of movement from one place to another with nothing but one's own body and while overcoming any obstacles in the way. Today the term isn't used that strictly but also includes free running which introduces more "inefficient" movement such as flips or other "flow" moves. You can learn more about all that in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour>Wikipedia article about Parkour</a>.</div></details><div id=what-do-i-need-to-do-parkour class=anchor></div><details><summary><span class=faq-question>What do I need to do Parkour?<span></summary><div class=faq-answer>Two things are relevant: Clothing and shoes. Your clothing shouldn't limit your mobility, ideal are most kinds of "sports clothing" or "loose clothing" that you don't trip over. E.g. skinny jeans might limit your movement too much. Your shoes shouldn't be too stiff so you still feel the surfaces with your feet. Most kinds of trainers are fine but there are also a lot of normal sneakers that are very good for doing Parkour. "The best shoes for Parkour" are a science unto itself and it's a very individual thing. It's not that important when starting out.</div></details></p><p> </p><h2 id=contribute>Contribute</h2><p><div id=how-can-i-have-a-say-in-when-and-where-the-trainings-take-place class=anchor></div><details><summary><span class=faq-question>How can I have a say in when and where the trainings take place?<span></summary><div class=faq-answer>There's a chat group to discuss this.
